We have learned what Session and Cookies are and we had our dummy authentication
flow in place, let's dive into real authentication. This mean that in this
chapter (module), we'll add a functionality that allows Users to `sign up`,
`sign in` and we'll make sure that some resources can really only be accessed by
User who are signed in, and that we're not just hiding the menu options but that
we really lock down access. We will also store `password` securely

So in this module we'll have a look at what exactly **authentication is**, **how
it works** in NodeJS application or in web application in general because this
actually this is not limited to NodeJS, authentication would be implemented in
backend languages in the same way.

We'll have a look at how we can **store and use the credential**, so the email
and the password with which the User signed up and we will dive into **protecting
routes** to make sure Users are only able to access the routes they need to
access and that we don't just hide the menu options but that we really check the
**permissions** on the server side.
