<br/>

Welcome to this module, the best things always come at the end. In this module.
I want to dive into an exciting piece of technology with you, we'll dive into
GraphQL. It's an alternative to building a RESTFUL API that you would use in the
same scenarios.

So, when you have de-coupled frontend and backend, you will not render views
with GraphQL API to, but it provides some significant advantages over REST API;
at least in certain scenarios.

In this module, we'll explore what GraphQL actually is, and how it compare to
REST API, and you'll learn how to use GraphQL of course. We'll actually take our
existing project and turn it into GraphQL API, or use GraphQL API.

It's a very excited technology, I'm super excited to get started with it.
