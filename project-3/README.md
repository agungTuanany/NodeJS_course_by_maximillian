## What is Project-3 ?

This is the project from "chapter-7-enhancing-app". Chapter-7 doesn't have any
explanatory, it's all writing a code.

In the end of this course we build a **online shop**; we need build some pages
that represent online shop.

In project-3 we build a `starting page`, we need a page where we can view all
the products that are listed.

As an **administrator** we want to be able to `create`, `edit`, and `delete`
a product. Pages in admin:
- add product
- admin product

As a **customer** view we want to be able to `add` a product to cart page. Pages
in customer:
- shop
- products
- cart
- orders
- checkout
- pay

**HINT**: much code base in `./views` folder.
