## What is this Project-3 ?

This is the project from "chapter-7-enhancing-app". As in this chapter I don't
have many explanatory for theory. Chapter-7 is full of writing code.

In the end of this course we build a **online shop**; we need a couple of pages
that represent **online shop**.

In this project we build a `starting page`, we need a page where we can view all
the products that are listed; As an **administrator** we want to be able to
`create`, `edit`, and `delete` a product.

As a `customer` view we want to be able to `add` product to a `shopping cart`
page, be able to see our order in `orders` page, to go to a `checkout` page, and
`pay` for the product.

HINT: much code base in `./views` folder.
