## What is this Project-1 ?

This is a sample project from
"[chapter-4-working-with-ExpressJS-bases](./../chapter-4-working-with-express)";
And as the
"[chapter-5-working-with-templates-engines](./../chapter-5-working-with-dynamic-content-adding-templating-engines)",
I don't want to mixed from now on.

Let "chapter-4-working-with-ExpressJS-bases" the as a backbone code.
