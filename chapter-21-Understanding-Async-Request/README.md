## Module Introduction

Thus far in this we always had a look at a particular kind of _request_ and
_response_. The _request was always_ sent form our browser, when we submitted
a form or entered a URL or clicked a link and the _response always_ either
a _redirect_ or a new HTML page.

That can take you very far, but sometimes you get some work request that will
only happen behind the scene. Means you don't want to get back to HTML page,
you only want to exchange some data with the server, for example; And I'll show
you what I mean and how this work in this module.

We'll have a look at _what asynchronous JavaScript request are?_ Why we should
use them?  And how we will use them.
