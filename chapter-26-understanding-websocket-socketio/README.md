<br/>

A lot of exciting things were covered in the last modules, REST API,
async-await, and we'll continue on that road. We'll dive into a very exciting
technology that you can use in NodeJS applications, WebSocket.

WebSocket are a nice way, a protocol essentially which allows us to build
real-time Web Services. Now what exactly does that mean? How does it work?.
That's what we'll cover in this module.

You'll learn why you would want to use real-time Web Services? And what that
actually is?, and we'll see how we add real-time communication to our NodeJS app
or to any NodeJS app, of course we'll use a certain library fro that
`socket.io`, and I will teach you everything you need to know about, why to use
it, how it works, what you can do with `socket.io`, and how you use it in your
project.
