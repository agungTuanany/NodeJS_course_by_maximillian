## What is Project-4 ?

This is the project from
"[chapter-8-dynamic-routes-advances-model](./../chapter-8-dynamic-routes-advances-model)".

As deep in course; Max doesn't explain any theory; however he show me the
programming technique when you get **logic error**. As you get if you watch
Max videos.

In project-4 Max explain how **pass some dynamic data** through `routes`.
**Encode** some information in `url` (path) so we can pass a `productId` as part
of  the `url`.

Max also explain when should **submit** or **send** data through the `url`;
and when should **not** to **send** data through `url` and put it into
`request.body` instead.

In project-4 we also continuing working with `models`; learn about how to
pass `route parameters`; how to use `query parameters`; both **important**
things that `EpressJS` support  `router`.

In project-4 we'll also use `ExpressJS` `router` methods to enhance our
`models`; and with that we add more functionalities and  **new** `models`.
