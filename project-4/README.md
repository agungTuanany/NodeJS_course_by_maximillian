## What is this Project-4 ?

This is the project from "chapter-8-dynamic-routes-advances-model". As deep in
with 'max' course; 'max' doesn't explain any theory; however he show me the
programming technique when you get in **logic error**; as you get if
you watch 'max' videos.

In this "project-4" 'max' explain how **pass some dynamic data** through
`routes`. **Encode** some information in `url` (path) so we can pass
a `productID` as part of  the `url`.

'max' also explain when should **submit** or **send** data through the `url`;
and when should **not** to **send** data through `url` and put it into
`request.body` instead.

In this "project-4" we also continuing working with `models`; learn about how to
pass `route parameters`; how to use `query parameters`; both **important**
things that `EpressJS` `router` supports.

In this "project-4" we'll also use `ExpressJS` `router` methods to enhance our
`models`; and with that will add more functionalities; add some **new**
`models`.
