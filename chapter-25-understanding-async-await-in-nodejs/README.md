<br/>

You've learn about a brand new type of backend application you can build with
NodeJS a RESTFUL API; and you learn that it's not that far off from the
server-side rendering (classic NodeJS apps) we built before. The only major
differences is how you handle request and response data; You send JSON data, now
with that out of the way,

I want to dive into something totally different which is applicable to any
NodeJS application, not just to RESFUL API. I want to dive into _async-await
keyword_, which is relatively new JavaScript language feature, which you can
use, again in any place in your NodeJS code, this does not have to be used in
a RESTFUL API, you can or can not use it anywhere.

I will explain what's up with this two keywords, how you used them? And why you
would use them?.
