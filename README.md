### Why you want to build your server on top NodeJS?

NodeJS is Server-Side Scripting Technology built with JavaScript and runs on
Chrome V8 engine. The same JavaScript rendering engine as Chrome Browser.

This JavaScript runtime environment offers many benefits, such as performance,
scalability, strong library, high performance application, asynchronous events,
event driven architecture, advanced community, etc.

### How Good is NodeJS?

Look up this [answer](https://www.quora.com/How-good-is-Node-js?share=1)

### Why you wrote all of this course?

I wrote this all, with the samples in every chapter and project, cause I know
someday in next years I've to repeat what I read. If I repeat myself by watching
video over and over again without writing it, I'm only renting the knowledge,
not owning it.

### Why to many projects?

I write it like this, so I could learn to be more focused on getting the essence
of how NodeJS works in it's world. Many 3rd party library need comprehensive
research on how to write and use with SOLID principal.
