In this module let's have a look at something you can't avoid, it's an error.
There will be errors in the application in the web pages you create and some
errors can of course avoid it by testing your code properly. But some errors are
due to happen.

You will always have some bug issues in your code and even if you don't, your
database server might be off-line, users do send an invalid data. So there will
be errors, and in this module we'll have take a look at _different type of an
errors_, _how to handle these different types of errors_ in an elegant way in
your NodeJS Express application.
